# CalculusViz.jl
Educational demonstrations and visualizations for teaching and learning Calculus and related subjects.

Most of the files here are Pluto notebooks, created using Julia. I will (eventually...) create PDFs/HTML docs of each of them for people to read and use for their own study.

To edit please use Pluto.
